# Next.js Booster

## Propulse your Next.js application with a minimal state of the art template.

A minimal template to propulse your Next.js application with a state of the art tech stack, lint and format rules:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4)
- [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)

## Goal

The goal is to provide a minimal template for Next.js applications in TypeScript. The template is meant to be as minimal as possible, just enough to kick start your application without having to write boilerplate code.

By using a very small set of features, this template aims to be easy to update so that latest packages are always in use. This comes with some benefits:

- Easily maintanable
- Easily extendable
- Suits most needs

## Note on state management

We recommend using [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) instead of Redux for state management. But considering how popular Redux is we chose to keep it as default for now.

## What is missing

### Styling

This repo does not give any guideline for styling for now, we recommend giving a look at [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).
